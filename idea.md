Bangalore's AQI keeps getting worse and I'm just sick and tired of people not giving a shit about it. So I was thinking of creating a depressing site and the tentaitve name is howfuckedarewe.in

Instead of just showing the usual line and bar charts of AQI data, I want to think of a newwer, lay person friendly way of showing the AQUI data like, how many days of lifespan are you losing, equivalent of smoking X cigarettes based on som sound scientific logic. At the same time, I don't want this site to another one of those data dashboards. It's mean to jolt and awaken people and start giving a shit about the pathetic nature of the air quality in bangalore. How do we go about this? 

I found some data sources here

This air quality monitoring station real-time data can be programmatically accessed using this API url:

[WAQI API & Data Platform](https://api.waqi.info/feed/@8190/?token=__YOUR_TOKEN__)
